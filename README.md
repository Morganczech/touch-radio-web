## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Static site generator
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with CSS custom properties
- **Data Source**: [Radio Browser API](https://www.radio-browser.info/)
- **Deployment**: Netlify (or any static host)

## 📡 Data Source

Station data is fetched from the [Radio Browser API](https://www.radio-browser.info/), a community-driven database of radio stations. The data is fetched at build time and stored locally for fast access.

### Update Station Data

```bash
npm run fetch:stations
```

This fetches the top 7,500 voted and clicked stations, merges them, and normalizes the data.

### Automated Updates

The station list is automatically updated **weekly on Sunday at 4:00 AM UTC** via GitHub Actions. The workflow can also be started manually from the Actions tab. If you fork this repository, you must enable **Read and write permissions** in `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions` for the automation to work.
